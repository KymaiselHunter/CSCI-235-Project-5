                Description: A string
                Completion Status: 0 (False) or 1 (True)

                Dependencies: A list of Quest titles of the form [QUEST1];[QUEST2], where each quest is separated by a semicolon. The value may be NONE.
                Subquests: A list of Quest titles of the form [QUEST1];[QUEST2], where each quest is separated by a semicolon. The value may be NONE.
            Notes:
                - The first line of the input file is a header and should be ignored.
                - The dependencies and subquests are separated by a semicolon and may be NONE.
                - The dependencies and subquests may be in any order.
                - If any of the dependencies or subquests are not in the list, they should be created as new quests with the following information:
                    - Title: The title of the quest
                    - Description: "NOT DISCOVERED"
                    - Completion Status: False

                    - Dependencies: An empty vector
                    - Subquests: An empty vector
                - However, if you eventually encounter a quest that matches one of the "NOT DISCOVERED" quests while parsing the file, you should update all the quest details.
